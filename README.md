### Hi, I'm Shannon ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a research and project assistant seeking to utilise data for sustainable change in the international development sector. 

I wish to support communities with a career in the non-profit sector with a focus on social justice and empowering communities. Especially focused on how data can be used to form solutions, challenge established truths, and facilitate change. A recent MSc International Development graduate and currently expanding my data analyst skills with a certificate in Data Analytics from the University of Birmingham.
